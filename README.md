# Community Unity

The idea of Community Unity is a place where people can connect with their community: sell, donate, meet up, and find a friend.  Basically, a portal connecting people.  A few examples would be; 

-  I’m selling a fish tank
-   I’m donating my infant car seat, she’s a toddler now.
-   I’m looking for someone to watch the Knicks game with tonight…anyone?
-   I’m bummed out, I lost my job and I could really use someone to talk to over a cup of coffee.

## User Stories
